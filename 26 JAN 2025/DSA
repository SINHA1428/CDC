541.Reverse String II

Given a string s and an integer k, reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string.

If there are fewer than k characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first k characters and leave the other as original.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2
Output: "bacdfeg"
Example 2:

Input: s = "abcd", k = 2
Output: "bacd"
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 104
s consists of only lowercase English letters.
1 <= k <= 104

SOLUTION:

#include <string>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
string reverseStr(string s, int k){
    int n = s.size();
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i += 2 * k){
        int end = min(i + k - 1, n - 1);
        reverse(s.begin() + i, s.begin() + end + 1);
    }
    return s;
}


53. Maximum Subarray

Companies
Given an integer array nums, find the 
subarray
 with the largest sum, and return its sum.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: The subarray [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum 6.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
Explanation: The subarray [1] has the largest sum 1.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [5,4,-1,7,8]
Output: 23
Explanation: The subarray [5,4,-1,7,8] has the largest sum 23.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
